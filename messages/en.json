        "stackAndExplanation": "For this project, I chose Next.js 15 with the App Router as the foundation—server-side rendering, strong SEO, and edge-ready performance made it a clear fit. React 19 provided the UI layer and TypeScript ensured type safety across the codebase, catching errors before they reached production.<br></br><br></br>For the backend I used Firebase (Firestore + built-in auth) to avoid server management while keeping real-time sync and easy scalability. For the API layer I paired tRPC with TanStack Query for end-to-end typesafe calls, efficient caching, and smooth data synchronization.<br></br><br></br>The UI was built with TailwindCSS and Radix UI for fast, accessible styling, while React Hook Form and Zod handled performant form state and validation. I also added Storybook, Vitest, and Playwright to streamline component development, unit tests, and end-to-end checks—creating a reliable workflow for a modern finance app."

        "stackAndExplanation": "For this project, I decided to use the MERN stack along with Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Radix UI, and Beautiful DnD. The MERN stack felt like a natural choice—MongoDB gave me the flexibility I needed for storing task data, Express made it easy to build a solid backend, React kept the frontend development smooth, and Node.js brought everything together seamlessly.<br></br><br></br>Since I’d already worked with Tailwind CSS and Zustand in past projects, I stuck with them here. Tailwind’s utility-first approach let me quickly build a clean and responsive interface, while Zustand kept state management simple without adding unnecessary complexity.<br></br><br></br>To round things out, I pulled in Radix UI and Beautiful DnD. Radix UI gave me accessible and consistent UI components right out of the box, and Beautiful DnD made drag-and-drop interactions effortless—exactly what I needed for a smooth Kanban experience."

        "stackAndExplanation": "I first thought about using Create React App, but after reading up on best practices, I switched to Next.js. The docs were clear and easy to follow, so I felt confident jumping in—and it really did make the process smoother.<br></br><br></br>This project was also my chance to finally try Tailwind CSS. At first, I hated seeing a bunch of classes crammed into every element. It felt messy and hard to remember. But as I kept building, it started to click, and now I actually enjoy how fast it makes styling."

        "stackAndExplanation": "For this project, I went with HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. I chose these technologies to solidify my understanding of the core tools in web development before jumping into more complex frameworks. Now, you might wonder why I picked Sass over plain old CSS. Well, dealing with one massive CSS file can be a nightmare. Sass, on the other hand, keeps everything organized and tidy. If I need to tweak a style, I can do it without tearing my hair out searching through lines of code."
